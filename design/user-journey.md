# User Journey

This system serves two types of users: customers and baristas. We will provide separate user journeys for each type to illustrate how they interact with the voice-enabled ordering system.

## Customer User Journey

A customer approaches the counter craving their usual morning coffee. The cashier scans their QR code, which immediately identifies them and displays their name and order history on the screen. The cashier has the option to use the traditional order form like a typical POS system or choose voice mode to simply repeat the customer's order. The customer speaks their order naturally: "I'll have a grande caramel macchiato with almond milk and an extra shot." The cashier repeats the order back to confirm accuracy in the noisy cafe environment. The customer confirms the order, and they see the final order details displayed on the screen. Since this is a membership-based cafe, no payment is required. The customer receives order confirmation with an estimated completion time and moves to the pickup area to wait. When their order is ready, they receive a notification and pick up their perfectly prepared drink from the designated area. After enjoying their drink, the customer is prompted to provide feedback through an LLM-based feedback system that can be anonymous if desired. This feedback is analyzed and used to continuously improve the service quality and customer experience.

## Barista User Journey

A barista starts their shift by logging into the POS system. When a customer approaches the counter, the cashier scans the customer's QR code, and the barista sees the ordering screen with customer information. The cashier then has the option to activate voice mode for this order or use the traditional POS interface. If voice mode is activated, the voice detection interface becomes ready. As the customer speaks their order, the system transcribes the speech in real-time, displaying the live transcription on the barista's screen. The barista repeats the order back to the customer for confirmation, ensuring accuracy despite the noisy cafe environment and maintaining privacy by having the system primarily detect the cashier's voice rather than the customer's. If the customer requests changes, the barista speaks the modifications: "Latte with oat milk instead of cappuccino." The LLM processes these spoken changes and automatically updates the order, showing the revised details on the barista's screen. The barista reviews the complete order, makes any necessary manual adjustments to quantities or special instructions, and confirms the order in the POS system. The order is automatically sent to the preparation station. The barista receives the order details on their preparation screen, prepares the drink according to specifications, and marks the order as complete in the system, which automatically notifies the customer that their order is ready. The barista calls out the customer's name, and the customer picks up their completed order, completing the transaction efficiently and accurately.
